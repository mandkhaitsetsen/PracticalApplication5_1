Finding Summary



Demographics:

Single drivers were far more likely to use coupons, followed by unmarried with partners. Single drivers with income between $ 62,500 - $75,000 most likely to use coupons, while unmarried drivers with partners with income between $87,500 - $100,000 tend to use the coupons. Furthermore, people with less education tend to use coupons at higher rate. It should be noted that the both Single and Unmarried with partner drivers tend to be in their early 20’s. 



Coupon Types:

Drivers tend to use coupons that are expiring within 1 day at higher rate than those expiring within two hours. There were little to no correlation between weather the restaurants were in the same driving direction or not. The most successful type of coupon was those made more Carry Outs & Takeaways, while the least successful were those for Bars. However, drivers who go to bars more than 4 times a month tend to use Bar coupons at much higher rate. Carry Outs & Takeaway coupons seem to be popular among drivers who normally don’t do carryouts. Drivers who go to cheap restaurants more often are less likely to use carry out & takeaway coupons. 


Drive type:

Drivers who are commuting, whether to home or to work, accepts the coupon half of the time. However, when drivers are on leisure drives, then tend to accept coupons at 63% of the time. 


Recommendations:
 
Carry Outs and Takeaway coupons are the most popular coupons and it should be targeted towards drivers who are single or unmarried with partners. The drivers would be also in the early to mid 20’s and in a higher income bracket. The coupon expiration should be set at 1 day, and 2h coupon expirations should be eliminated. Coupons for Bars are least popular, and it should only be catered towards drivers who are inclined to go to bars. It should be noted that we cannot tell weather bar coupon encourages drivers to go to bars more often, or that people who already goes to bars frequently uses the coupon more often.
